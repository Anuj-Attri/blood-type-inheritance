# Blood Type Inheritance

This is a program that can create a punnet square to identify the inherited blood type of an offspring. 

## Input & Output
For the computation, we require the user to input the blood type and the rhesus factor of the parents. 
The output will consist of probabilities that suggest what the offspring's blood type can be, however the answer is not certain and just a prediction.

## Evaluation
For evaluation, the program needs to pass the following parameters:
   
	 * Correct probabilities of offspring's blood type are predicted.
	 * Proper Rh-factor for all resulting types.
	 * Accurate percentage for each resulting blood type.

## Usage:
To use this program on your local host:
* Fork this repository, and then clone it on your device.
* Run [main.py](https://github.com/Anuj-Attri/blood-type-inheritance/blob/master/main.py) using `python main.py`.
